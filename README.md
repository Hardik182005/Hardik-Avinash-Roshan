# Minesweeper Game created by Hardik-Avinash-Roshan 
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game, originally released in the 1960s. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. 

In the context of programming with C, creating a Minesweeper game would involve using data structures (like arrays for the game board), control flow (loops and conditionals for gameplay mechanics), and possibly some simple graphics for displaying the board to the user. It's a great project for practicing these fundamental concepts.
