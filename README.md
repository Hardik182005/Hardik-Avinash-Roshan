# Minesweeper Game created by Hardik-Avinash-Roshan 
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game, originally released in the 1960s. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. 
This is a simple console-based Minesweeper game. The game starts by initializing a game board and placing mines at random positions. The player is then asked to enter the coordinates of the cell they want to reveal. If the cell contains a mine, the game ends. If not, the cell is revealed and the game continues.

Please note that this is a basic version of Minesweeper and doesn't include features like flagging mines or winning the game when all non-mine cells are revealed. You might want to enhance this code to add these features and improve the gameplay.

In the context of programming with C, creating a Minesweeper game would involve using data structures (like arrays for the game board), control flow (loops and conditionals for gameplay mechanics), and possibly some simple graphics for displaying the board to the user. It's a great project for practicing these fundamental concepts.
